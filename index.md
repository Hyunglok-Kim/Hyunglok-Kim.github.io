I received my Ph.D. degree in Civil Engineering (2022) and my M.S. in Data Science (2021) at the University of Virginia (UVa), VA, USA. I am studying hydrology, applications of Bayesâ€™ theorem, and global-scale water cycles. __The overarching goal of my research is to provide accurate hydrological variables and solve the major challenges related to Earth system science that we will face in the coming decades__. My work has practical applications for improving the quantity and quality of satellite- and model-based data to more accurately predict natural disasters and to provide a better understanding of the role played by hydrometeorological factors.

## Current Interests:
- Applications of Deep Learning to Hydrology
- Bayesian Inference
- Remote Sensing (Radiometer, GNSS, and Radar)
- Global Water Cycle
- Natural Disasters: Urban Flooding, Droughts, and Dust Outbreaks

## Current Projects:
- Soil moisture retrievals from satellites (passive, active, and GPS signals), reanalysis data, and in situ sensors.
- Satellite-based soil moisture data assimilation into land surface models.
- Impact of human activities (irrigation, crop modifications, etc.) on global soil moisture dynamics.
