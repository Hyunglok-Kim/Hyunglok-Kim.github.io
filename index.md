Starting from August 2023, I have taken up the position of an assistant professor at GIST in Korea, having transitioned from my prior role as a research scientist at the USDA-ARS Hydrology and Remote Sensing Laboratory. Prior to this, I attained my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering (2022) and M.S. in Data Science (2021) from the University of Virginia (UVa), located in VA, USA. My current research focuses on hydrology, the utilization of Bayes' theorem, and the intricate water cycles at a global scale. You can find more about my work on my new website: __*HydroAI*__ </span>](https://hydroai.net). __The overarching goal of my research is to provide accurate hydrological variables and solve the major challenges related to Earth system science that we will face in the coming decades__. My work has practical applications for improving the quantity and quality of satellite- and model-based data to more accurately predict natural disasters and to provide a better understanding of the role played by hydrometeorological factors.
