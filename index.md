I am a Ph.D. candiate (3rd year) at the Department of Engineering Systems and Environment in University of Virginia where I am studying hydrology, applications of Bayesâ€™ theorem, and global-scale water cycles. The overarching goal of my research is to provide accurate hydrological variables and solve the major challenges related to Earth system science that we will face in the coming decades. My work has practical applications for improving the quantity and quality of satellite- and model-based data to more accurately predict natural disasters and to provide a better understanding of the role played by hydrometeorological factors.
You can find [<span style="color: blue"> __*two*__ </span>](https://hyunglok-kim.github.io/projects/) of the many intriguing projects on which I am working.

## Current Interests:
- Applications of Deep Learning in Hydrology
- Remote Sensing of Environment
- Global Water Cycle
- Natural Disasters: Urban Floodings, Droughts, and Dust Outbreaks

## Current Projects:
- Soil moisture retrievals from satellites (passive, active, and GPS signals), reanalysis data, and in situ sensors.
- Satellite-based soil moisture data assimilation into land surface models.
- Impact of human activities (irrigation, modifying crops, etc.) on the global soil moisture dynamics.
