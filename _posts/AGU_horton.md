I am deeply honored and excited to have been selected for a prestigious Horton Research Grant in 2020 in support of my doctoral research at the University of Virginia. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to write my story here.

I can still recall the exact time and place when I decided on the course of my future career. The words reverberate in my memory and stir my emotions even today: “Main engine start and liftoff of the Delta II rocket with SMAP, making global observations of soil moisture for climate forecasting.” With these words, NASA’s SMAP satellite was launched into space on January 31, 2015; and I was certain that I was watching a seminal moment in the advancement of our shared knowledge of global climate systems. Later, in my first year of Ph.D. studies, I seized the opportunity for a summer internship at the United States Department of Agriculture and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). There, for the first time, I watched as researchers utilized satellite data and numerical modeling to predict natural disasters and investigate the water cycle. This experience kindled my research interests in global-scale hydrology and earth system science.

SMAP Lift-off

I am currently pursuing both my Ph.D. (3rd year) and a master’s degree in data science at UVA, where I am studying hydrology, applications of Bayes’ theorem, and global-scale water cycles. The overarching goal of my research is to provide accurate hydrological variables and solve the major challenges related to Earth system science that we will face in the coming decades. My work has practical applications for improving the quantity and quality of satellite- and model-based data to more accurately predict natural disasters and to provide a better understanding of the role played by hydrometeorological factors. I would like to briefly introduce two of the many intriguing projects on which I am working.

Thanks to the support of the AGU Horton Hydrology Research Grant, I will now have more flexibility and intellectual freedom to think outside the box. With this grant, my life’s work of better understanding of the water cycle and helping people adapt to the greater frequency of hydrological impacts of  severe weather, viz. droughts, floods, landslides, etc. Now I feel certain that I am on the right track to becoming an expert who can help solve the major challenges Earth system science will face in the coming decades. 
(a) Satellite-based soil moisture observation systems and (b) Water cycle over land.

In conclusion, I give heartfelt thanks to my advisor, Dr. Venkat Lakshmi, for his generous advice regarding both my research journey and life in general. I would like to close my letter with a quote from him that I love the most: “If people are not kind to others, there is no reason to live”.
