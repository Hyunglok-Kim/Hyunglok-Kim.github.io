I am deeply honored and excited to have been selected for a prestigious Horton Research Grant in 2020 in support of my doctoral research at the University of Virginia. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to write my story here.

I can still recall the exact time and place when I decided on the course of my future career. The words reverberate in my memory and stir my emotions even today: “Main engine start and liftoff of the Delta II rocket with SMAP, making global observations of soil moisture for climate forecasting.” With these words, NASA’s SMAP satellite was launched into space on January 31, 2015; and I was certain that I was watching a seminal moment in the advancement of our shared knowledge of global climate systems. Later, in my first year of Ph.D. studies, I seized the opportunity for a summer internship at the United States Department of Agriculture and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). There, for the first time, I watched as researchers utilized satellite data and numerical modeling to predict natural disasters and investigate the water cycle. This experience kindled my research interests in global-scale hydrology and earth system science.

SMAP Lift-off

I am currently pursuing both my Ph.D. (3rd year) and a master’s degree in data science at UVA, where I am studying hydrology, applications of Bayes’ theorem, and global-scale water cycles. The overarching goal of my research is to provide accurate hydrological variables and solve the major challenges related to Earth system science that we will face in the coming decades. My work has practical applications for improving the quantity and quality of satellite- and model-based data to more accurately predict natural disasters and to provide a better understanding of the role played by hydrometeorological factors. I would like to briefly introduce two of the many intriguing projects on which I am working.

__The first project__ is titled “Developing a method for a satellite-based soil moisture retrieval algorithm using GPS signals”. Last year, I was fortunate enough to secure the NASA research grant (FINNEST - expand) for the period 2019-2022 for this project, and this scholarship is now supporting me in pursuit of my master’s degree in Data Science. In December 2016, NASA successfully launched the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation of eight micro-satellites into low Earth orbit1. CYGNSS was designed to measure the ocean’s surface wind field using a bistatic scatterometer technique with Global Positioning System (GPS) reflectometry receivers. In contrast to other well-known microwave-based soil moisture (SM) retrieval satellites in sun-synchronous orbit (SSO), such as SMOS and SMAP, which have revisit times of 1 to 3 days, the CYGNSS micro-satellites randomly receive surface-reflected GPS signals at several revisits per day. As the temporal repeat of the existing satellites in SSO ranges from about 1 to 3 days depending on overpass latitude, the higher temporal repeat of the eight micro-satellites would add value to existing microwave-based satellite SM retrieval systems. In a recent __[publication](https://github.com/Hyunglok-Kim/Hyunglok-Kim.github.io/blob/master/pdf/10.Kim%26Lakshmi_2018_GRL.pdf)__, I proposed a method of using CYGNSS observations in SM estimates; and I emphasized three main benefits of using CYGNSS-derived SM data2: 1) Filling the gap in SSO satellite observations to allow temporally continuous observations, 2) Improving the accuracy of current data assimilation systems, and 3) Allowing analysis of observational-based diurnal SM variability in areas that have not been studied before, using existing space-borne microwave and bistatic radar techniques.

__The second project__ I would like to discuss is called “Assimilating satellite-based soil moisture data into land surface models based on parallel computing”. Various factors can increase errors in remotely-sensed soil moisture (SM) retrievals and land surface models (LSM) SM products3-5. SM in LSM will be affected by the model parameters and formulation, as well as by errors in the meteorological forcing variables. Specifically, anthropogenic effects such as irrigation activities cannot be integrated into LSMs without observational data. Recently, in order to remedy these uncertainties in both remotely sensed and LSM-based SM products, and to produce superior combined SM estimates, the Earth Science field has begun discussion of land data assimilation systems based on an Ensemble Kalman filter (or other filters)6-7. The LSM-based SM is revised using observational estimates contingent on the degree of correction regulated by the level of error associated with the model and observational products. These revised SM estimates affect the quality of antecedent wetness conditions, meaning that they can improve our knowledge of SM status and allow us to better forecast extreme climate events8. Assimilation systems and SM estimates from current sun-synchronous orbit satellites provide only limited surface wetness conditions because of the discontinuity in spatial and temporal coverage. However, I believe that integrating high temporal resolution SM data from space has the potential to efficiently complete the SM diurnal cycle and improve hydrologic simulations in LSMs. In a recent __[publication](https://github.com/Hyunglok-Kim/Hyunglok-Kim.github.io/blob/master/pdf/16.Kim_etal_2020_RSE.pdf)__, I proposed to assimilate sub-daily scale CYGNSS and SMAP into land surface models; and I emphasized three main benefits of assimilating CYGNSS- and SMAP-derived  SM data2: 1) Estimate of soil moisture from SMAP and CYGNSS sensors can add significant value in improving performance of global-scale land surface models, 2) By assimilating frequent CYGNSS observations, surface soil moisture estimates from land surface models can be further improved, and 3) The error characteristics of global-scale SMAP- and CYGNSS-assimilated soil moisture data are obtained using triple collocation analysis.

Thanks to the support of the AGU Horton Hydrology Research Grant, I will now have more flexibility and intellectual freedom to think outside the box. With this grant, my life’s work of better understanding of the water cycle and helping people adapt to the greater frequency of hydrological impacts of  severe weather, viz. droughts, floods, landslides, etc. Now I feel certain that I am on the right track to becoming an expert who can help solve the major challenges Earth system science will face in the coming decades.

In conclusion, I give heartfelt thanks to my advisor, Dr. Venkat Lakshmi, for his generous advice regarding both my research journey and life in general. I would like to close my letter with a quote from him that I love the most: “If people are not kind to others, there is no reason to live”.
