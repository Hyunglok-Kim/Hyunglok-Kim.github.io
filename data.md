# Ready-to-use grid-based data produced from the current projects

## 1. Data sets shown in Kim et al. 2021 ERL
Global-scale sub-daily CYGNSS and SMAP assimilated data including soil moisture (4 layers), evapotranspiration, land surface temperature (4 layers), excess rainfall, etc. from Noah-MP land surface model can be downloaded _[here]()_

## 2. Data sets shown in Kim and Lakshmi 2018 GRL
CONUS-scale CYGNSS-based soil moisture data can be downloaded _[here]()_

- If you need certain formats for the data sets (e.g., NetCDF, HDF, bin, text, etc.), please let me know.
- If the the links above do not work, please email me.
